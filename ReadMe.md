* Zips up your source code files into a single archive which contains only the files that have been changed since the last analysis. This archive will not include binary files located under the `/bin` and `/obj` folders. This filter may be expanded upon in the ignore list. 
* This project began as a simple source code backup/sync utility and grew into a more complex demonstration of other **WinUI** features.
* One of the main goals during the writing of this application was to not use any 3rd party libraries; so you'll find classes such as `RelayCommand`, `ObservableObject`, et. al. I maintain a large collection of solutions at work and one of my pet peeves is the "ghosting" of some **NuGets** as they age. There have been many times during development on a large system where a **NuGet** that the application base was designed with is no longer supported or updated, causing the entire project to need revamping. (c'est la vie for programmers)
* You will find that some of the contents have no practical purpose, e.g. the `AcrylicRectangle` on the `SplitView` settings panel, but it is more for UX to show how one might accomplish the effect if it was required.
* I highly recommend keeping this project in an **Unpackaged** format, as it was meant to be a portable utility.
* I've included an exhaustive collection of helpers that one can use in any WinUI project, such as the `NativeMethods`, `VisualTreeHelperExtensions`, `DispatcherQueueExtensions`, `Extensions` and `ModalView` libraries.
* I also tried to add extensive comments and notes to explain any caveats or idiosyncrasies with the **WinUI3** framework. If you have ever worked with **UWP** then you know that there can be major annoyances between **UWP** and **WinUI3**. Most of these issues arise from the `namespace` changes that *Microsoft* made, others are related to **Packaged** vs. **Unpackaged** apps. You can find a similar issue in the `App.xaml.cs` module concerning parsing of the `Microsoft.UI.Xaml.LaunchActivatedEventArgs` to which I provide a workaround. 
* One thing I've never seen on *Github* is any `csproj` that breaks down what the directive tags do, so if you open the `csproj` file you will find an extensive collection of what each tag does. I have setup the defaults to be the best configuration for an existing user who is coming from an older *VisualStudio* platform.
* Most of this code is my own doing, but you will find some code borrowed from other *Microsoft* repos, such as the `VisualTreeHelperExtensions`. When using other code snippets I have included links to their origin, or if it's a workaround you will find a the link to the relevant *Github* issue. If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me in the issue/discussion threads.

## üìã Proofing
* This application was compiled and tested using *VisualStudio* 2019/2022 on *Windows 10* versions **22H2**, **21H2** and **21H1**.
* I have done my best to include version specific checks in the application when warranted, however bugs may be found when using this on OS versions outside of the aforementioned versions.
* Superfluous tests can be found in the `MainWindow.xaml.cs` secondary constructor.
